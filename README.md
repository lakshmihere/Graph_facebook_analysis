# Graph_facebook_analysis

In this project, I will analyze a real network graph using python. I have used Networkx module to visualize a graph and to calculate some important measures which can describe characteristics of our graph. In particular, I used centrality measures to find important nodes in a graph. At the end of the project I delved into scale-free networks to prove that Facebook Network graph has familiarities with Scale-free networks.
